# H-RPVS-Dataset
Heilbronn Rooftop PV System Dataset (H-RPVS Dataset) was publicly available in paper "[Rooftop PV Segmenter: A Size-Aware Network for Segmenting Rooftop Photovoltaic Systems from High-Resolution Imagery](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/21/5232)" on [Remote Sensing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing).  

It is a public dataset for segmentation of small-scale rooftop photovoltaic systems from very high-resolution imagery. The H-RPVS Dataset contains 5866 pairs image of PV panel samples from Heilbronn, a city in Germany. The samples in H-RPVS Dataset were collected by Google Earth with the spatial resolutions of 0.15m. Each group of samples in composed a image of 256×256 pixels and a corresponding label of rooftop PV panels.
